# Predicting-Depreciation-of-Used-Vehicles

Vehicles depreciation rate is not uniform, even within manufacturer that makes pricing to be difficult to get the accurate prediction. Finding the depreciation rate per year for each car improve the accuracy of price prediction.

 - [Final Report](https://github.com/TemesgenGT/Predicting-Depreciation-Per-year-of-Used-Cars/blob/main/Project%20final%20report.pdf)
    This report covers the stages of data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and modeling performed for this project. 
 - [Project Presentation](https://github.com/TemesgenGT/Predicting-Depreciation-Per-year-of-Used-Cars/blob/main/Project%20Presentation-2.pdf)
   
The presentation summarizes the problem statement and defines the success criteria, scope, and limitations of the project. Moreover, visualization explained the association of key features versus target variable, and models performance outcome matrix, the most important features, plus elicit conclusion and recommendation. 
## Notebook
- [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/TemesgenGT/Predicting-Depreciation-of-Used-Vehicles/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)
phases, features extracted from the raw data, data cleaning and type conversion, and merging dataset tasks performed. 

- [EDA](https://github.com/TemesgenGT/Predicting-Depreciation-of-Used-Vehicles/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)
Each feature was analyzed and visualized, extreme outliers, duplicated and missing values, and features extraction from the existed dataset.


- [Preprocessing](https://github.com/TemesgenGT/Predicting-Depreciation-of-Used-Vehicles/blob/main/Preprocessing.ipynb)
- Removing redundant features for modeling, apply one hot encoder for categorical features and scaling the dataset, split the dataset into train and test were the prime of the task. 

- [Modeling](https://github.com/TemesgenGT/Predicting-Depreciation-of-Used-Vehicles/blob/main/Modeling.ipynb)
Five algorithms were tested to check the performance of the models, and extracted the most important features.
